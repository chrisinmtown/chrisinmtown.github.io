 # Validating Files for Unicode/UTF-8 Character Set

### 18 July 2011

Recently I've been using [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org)
to extract text from files containing all sorts of content,
and write that text to files using UTF-8 encoding.  After botching it
a few times I finally forced myself to learn a bit about encoding
systems and Java's representation of Unicode code points.  I also
learned that using the word "character" all too often leads to
confusion!

My colleague D. B. tells me that Java's support for international
character sets was written about the time the Unicode committee
finalized a standard that allowed a character to be represented in 16
bits.  Then after Sun's people cast that 16-bit assumption into
concrete deep within java.lang.Character and other classes, the
Unicode committee had a change of heart..  and now it takes 32 bits to
represent a character properly. This information is all well
documented at the Sun (oops I mean Oracle) Java API web site but it
took several reads before it started sink in for me.

What I learned, and what really bothers me still, is that a Java
String may contain parts (avoiding the "C" word here) that cannot be
represented using a single Java Character type!  In other words, using
the String.charAt(int) method gives back something that must be
handled with extreme care.  So iterating over the little parts that
make up a String is not as simple as I once thought.  And I have not
yet accustomed myself to using the String.codePointAt(int) method.

The task I had to accomplish was to check whether files contain
valid UTF-8 byte sequences.  Some tools were giving garbage results
and I needed to figure out why.  The basic java.io.InputStreamReader
will happily translate byte streams to character streams, but it does
not report encoding/decoding errors (also see <A
HREF="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4646959">
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4646959</A>).  I
found that the java.nio.charset package offers some help that does not
require loops to iterate over the parts in a String so I went with
that.

Below you will find the source code for an example Java class that
checks whether file content can be decoded using the UTF-8 character
set.  It also supports creation of a file with a character that is
valid in the ISO-8859-1 encoding system but not in the UTF-8 system so
you can test the class and see the exception that is thrown. </P>
