# Plans for a Garden Tool Rack

### 1 Jan 2009

![Finished tool rack](pix/tool-rack-built.jpg)

A few years ago I was fortunate enough to have some money *and* a
reliable contractor, and the result was a new garage.  But once it was
done, I couldn't bring myself to put nails or hooks into the shiny new
walls that I had just painted.  So I went off to look at tool racks.

I found some freestanding racks, but they were plastic, pretty
expensive and didn't seem to hold much.  Then while shopping at home
cheapo I saw a store display rack that looked about right, and I
figured I'd try copying it.  It worked out pretty well!

My design for a tool rack holds 30 garden tools in about four square
feet.  Plans and directions are below. I used whatever lumber was
lying around.  A few tips:

* I'm sure that different materials will work; for example, thicker
  plywood, 1x3 wood boards instead of 1x4 boards, etc.
* Make sure your hole saw is very sharp, and give it a chance to cool
  down between holes.  
* Adjust the number of connected holes depending on how many of
  your tools have wide handles, like snow shovels.
* You could use inside L brackets or outside (flat) brackets
  to connect the 1x4 frames.

Please drop me a line with a picture if you build one yourself!
Tell me what I forgot and I'll update this page.

## Materials

1. 1/2 sheet 1/2" Douglas fir plywood (4' x 4' x 1/2") <BR/>
   [or 3 pre-cut 2x2 sheets from a big-box store]
1. 3 pieces 1 x 4 pine @ 8'
1. 2 pieces 1 x 4 pine @ 10'
1. 12 L brackets @ 1 1/2"
1. Box of 100 flat-head wood screws #8 x 1 1/4"
1. 24 flat-head wood screws #8 x 3/4"

## Cut sheet

1. Panels: 3 @ 24" x 24" cut from 1/2" plywood
1. Panel frames: 12 @ 23 1/4" cut from 8' lengths
1. Legs: 8 @ 30" cut from 10' lengths

## Directions

1. Clamp two 2'x2' (top and middle) panels together.
1. Drill round holes 2" diameter on 4" centers, set in 1" from sides.
1. Connect some holes with a jig saw to make ovals as shown.
1. Build three panel frames with four 23 1/4" pieces of 1x4 by
   attaching L brackets on the inside corners with the 3/4" screws.
1. Attach panels to frames using the 1 1/4" screws.
1. Rip down four legs to 2 3/4" (if the table saw needs some
   exercise :-)
1. Attach legs to frame-panel assemblies using the 1 1/4" screws.
   Leave a gap between the middle and bottom frames for your hand,
   and another gap between the bottom frame and floor for a broom.

## Reader Feedback

Thanks to the people who wrote me about using these plans!

### October 2010

Chuck of Mansfield, TX sent me a picture of
this very fine rack he built using these plans.  Sure looks better than
mine!  He reports that it cost him $45 and four hours labor.

### August 2011

Pete H. of Seattle, WA sent me a picture and this note:

> The plans are spot on.  Appreciate the cutting notes for the boards. 
I used pre-cut 2x2 sheets of plywood from Home Cheapo. I added a set
of wheels on the bottom. I have this in a corner by the front of my
garage door and the wheels allow me to simple roll it out and access
any tool I need.  I had some left over stain so I used that you make
it look "richer".  Too fancy for the garage? The thing is solid and
does not tip or get top heavy, something that I was concerned about
with the store models. 

> Re wheels - Four swivel wheels from Home Depot... 2inch ... I still have
the bill... part number 039003094778 ... $3.48 each.

### April 2013

Gaizka L. built a custom version of this tool rack and sent me some details:

> I got mine built inspired by your design.
Thanks for the concept and the tips.
I didn't follow the blueprints, but borrowed some IP our of it.
I did include the wheels for easier access and also added a serrated
edge. That way I can just rest a tool that I'm currently using (or in
case the rack itself is full).
I also found a purchased tool hanger hanging around and I attached it
to the side.
It might be over-engineered, but is fun to see how it's been
evolving. I can clearly see where my thought process changed during
the build.

Brandon C. of Yorktown, TX made a double-wide tool rack:

> Just wanted to say thanks for sharing your tool rack plans. I built
one 2'x4' with 6 casters and a special hole for my fiskar post hole
diggers.
